# Core-X
### Don't let your abs become flabs with Core-X


### Purpose

I had the idea for this app a number of years ago back when I was in High School. I was a cross country runner and we often had to do the Core X workout routine (I don't claim to take credit for developing that routine, it can be easily found online).

Unfortunately, I could never seem to remember what order the exercises were in. So like any good prospective CS major, I built an app.

It started with just the original Core X routine and was just for my personal use but I have since generalized it and added other routines.

It can be found on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/core-x/id972403903) for download (for free!) and there are ads/in-app purchases to help support my development.

### Contributing

Contributors and feedback welcome :smile:. I am currently a full time student as well as working multiple other jobs so I make no guarantees that I'll be able to fix a bug. 

Pull requests are the best way to see the change you want in the world.

#### API Key

This app uses the Appodeal API. I have omitted my API key but you can add one if you'd like by using the `Creds.plist` file. I have included an example one that needs to be renamed to `Creds.plist` for it to work correctly.

### Features (WIP)

- Update for iOS 13
- Add support for Dark Mode
- Add Siri integration
- Clean up the source code (I did originally write this when I was 17 :smile:)
