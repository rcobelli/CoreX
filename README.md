### Don't let your abs become flabs with Core-X


### Purpose

I had the idea for this app a number of years ago back when I was in High School. I was a cross country runner and we often had to do the Core X workout routine (I don't claim to take credit for developing that routine, it can be easily found online).

Unfortunately, I could never seem to remember what order the exercises were in. So like any good prospective CS major, I built an app.

It started with just the original Core X routine and was just for my personal use but I have since generalized it and added other routines.

It can be found on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/core-x/id972403903) as a free download for iOS & tvOS. There are in-app purchases to help support development.
